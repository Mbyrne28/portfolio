## Situation
Knowledge Management is the process of creating, sharing, using and managing the knowledge and information of an organisation." For an energy company Knowledge Management is a big deal. It costs millions of dollars a year to maintain, and when ignored can lead to disaster; both environmental and human.

As a part of a larger Digital Transformation programme the energy company was consolidating parts of their business on the Salesforce platform. Moving knowledge managment practices from regional operations in to a centralised hub. For BP this is a very complicated task; many stakeholders, lots of opinions, and the subject itself is by nature is very technical.

The project lasted for 12 weeks. I led the team of 5 (researchers, service designers, and user experience) and was responsible for reporting to the client, coordinating the design work, and working closely with our build colleagues.
