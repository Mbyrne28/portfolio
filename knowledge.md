## Situation
â€œKnowledge Management "is the process of creating, sharing, using and managing the knowledge and information of an organisation."
For an energy company Knowledge Management is a big deal. It costs millions of dollars a year to maintain, and when ignored can lead to disaster; both environmental and human.
A part of a larger Digital Transformation programme the energy company was consolidating parts of their business on the Salesforce platform. Moving knowledge managment practices from regional operations in to a centralised hub.
For a large energy company this is a very complicated task; many stakeholders, lots of opinions, and the subject itself is by nature is very technical.
The initial phase of work would last 12 weeks.
I led the team of 5 (researchers, service designers, and user experience) and was responsible for reporting to the client, keeping the design work on track, and working closely with our build colleagues.
